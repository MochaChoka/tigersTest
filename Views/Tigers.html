            The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, reaching a total body length of up to 3.38 m (11.1 ft)
            over curves and weighing up to 388.7 kg (857 lb) in the wild. Its most recognisable feature is a pattern of
            dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus
            Panthera with the lion, leopard and jaguar. Like all felids, tigers are carnivorous, and primarily prey on
            ungulates such as deer and bovids. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often
            requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled with the
            fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant
            conflicts with humans.
            Tigers once ranged widely across Asia, from Turkey in the west to the eastern coast of Russia. Over the past
            100 years, they have lost 93% of their historic range, and have been extirpated from southwest and central Asia,
            from the islands of Java and Bali, and from large areas of Southeast and Eastern Asia. Today, they range
            from the Siberian taiga to open grasslands and tropical mangrove swamps. The remaining six tiger subspecies
            have been classified as endangered by IUCN. The global population in the wild is estimated to number between
            3,062 and 3,948 individuals, down from around 100,000 at the start of the 20th century, with most remaining
            populations occurring in small pockets isolated from each other. Major reasons for population decline
            include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation and poaching. The extent of area occupied by tigers is
            estimated at less than 1,184,911 km2 (457,497 sq mi, a 41% decline from the area estimated in the mid-1990s.

            Tigers can occupy a wide range of habitat types, but will usually require sufficient cover, proximity to
            , and an abundance of prey. Compared to the lion, the tiger prefers denser vegetation, for which its
            camouflage colouring is ideally suited, and where a single predator is not at a disadvantage compared with
            the multiple felines in a pride.[43] A further habitat requirement is the placement of suitably secluded
            den locations, which may consist of caves, large hollow trees, or dense vegetation.[48] Bengal tigers in
            particular live in many types of forests, including wet, evergreen, and the semievergreen of Assam and
            eastern Bengal; the swampy mangrove forest of the Ganges Delta; the deciduous forest of Nepal, and the
            thorn forests of the Western Ghats. In various parts of their range they inhabit or have inhabited
            additionally partially open grassland and savanna as well as taiga forests and rocky habitats.

            Mating can occur all year round, but is more common between November and April.[48] A female is only receptive
            for three to six days. Mating is frequent and noisy during that time. Gestation can range from 93 to 112 days,
            the average being 105 days.[48] The litter is usually two or three cubs, occasionally as few as one or as
            many as six. Cubs weigh from 680 to 1,400 g (1.50 to 3.09 lb) each at birth, and are born blind and helpless.
            [48] The females rear them alone, with the birth site and maternal den in a sheltered location such as a
            thicket, cave or rocky crevice. The father generally takes no part in rearing them. Unrelated wandering male
            tigers may kill cubs to make the female receptive, since the tigress may give birth to another litter within
            five months if the cubs of the previous litter are lost.[48] The mortality rate of tiger cubs is about 50%
            in the first two years.[48] Few other predators attack tiger cubs due to the diligence and ferocity of the
            mother tiger. Apart from humans and other tigers, common causes of cub mortality are starvation, freezing,
            and accidents.
